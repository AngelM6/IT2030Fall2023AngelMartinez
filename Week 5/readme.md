For week 5 lab continuing from week 2 lab, I put the two paragraphs on the home page into 2 separate columns, changed the color of the nav bar to dark blue, applied the img-fluid rounded class to the flower.png image and changed the heading on the homepage. 
I added an About Us page link to the nav bar as well as a razor view for the page and added the history, mission, and vison of MGN Clothing co.
I also added a Contact us page link to the nav bar and razor view for the page. Added a model called ContactModel.cs within the models folder to gather the information the user is inputting such as their first name, last name, address, phone number, email, and their message.
To allow the user to input their information, I added new folder in the views folder called “Contact” and created a razor view.
I then added ContactController.cs within the Controllers folder to have the two index action methods HttpGet attribute and return a View and HttpPost attribute to accept a ContactModel object as input and return a view of the model
I did have issues with this lab in ContactModel.cs within the Models folder I forgot to add a ? to public string since there were 6 properties I copied and pasted each one to go by quicker without making sure my syntax was fine before doing so and I also had logic errors in Index.cs.html within the Views and Contact folder and in ContactControllers.cs within the Controllers folder where I was not able to be able to submit the inputted data and clear button as I was receiving errors, but found my errors and fixed them.
