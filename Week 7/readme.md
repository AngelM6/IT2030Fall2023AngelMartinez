For week 7 lab I added a products page to my web app. I created the link in the nav bar called “products”, created a model class called ProductModel.cs within the Models folder and added five properties; Product Id, Product Name, Product Description, Product Image, and Product Price. I then added another class within the models folder called ProductData.cs to be able to return a list from the product model, added images for my products as well as inserted the product name, id and description. I also added a view called ListProducts.cshtml within the product folder in the views folder, I referenced the product model, added headers for the products, displayed the products and added a link for each of the products for their details as well as a button to take the user back to the home page. Following the details link, I created a razor view called Detail.cshtml to be able to display the detail of each product and a button to be able to return to the list of products. I finally added a controller called ProductController.cs within the controllers folder. Adding two actions for the controller to return the product list and the detail.
