<p>For week 9 lab I added a link for the FAQ page then created a razor view for the FAQ page. I used Bootstrap CSS classes to style and organize the content of the FAQ page. I added 6 common questions and answers within the CSS classes. I also added a class to the Models folder called MySession.cs with variables. I added another link to the navbar called tools and another razor view for the tools page. On the tools page, I added two action methods within the Home Controller. I displayed the variables that I added earlier. I added a button to display the four variables when clicked and a clear button to clear the variables I added so the user can input their own variables.</p>
Issues that I am currently having are adding the require session state services to my Program.cs file and the display button and clear button to function properly.
