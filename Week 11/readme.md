For week 11 lab I modified the ContactModel.cs fields that I created before from week 5 lab. I made it where only 30 characters were allowed and that no number or special characters were allowed to be entered for the First and Last name fields and had a error message display if they did add a number or special character. For the phone field I made it to where only 10 digits were allowed and no letters were able to be submitted. For the Email field I had a error message display if it was not a valid e-mail. I added data validation fields to ProductModel.cs for the Product Name, Description and Image making it where it is required and it displayed an error message to the user and a data type attribute in ProductPrice for the currency to the product price field. I added a Events link to the navbar and created a razor view for the Events page. I used Bootstrapâ€™s Card feature to add 4 different events with a description and title. Along with the events I included the date, time, location, specified age group and how users can register for each event. I then finally added an action method to display the Events page in the HomeController.
